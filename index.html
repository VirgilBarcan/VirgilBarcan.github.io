<h3>Software Developer, UiPath Romania</h3>
<h4>January 2022 - Present</h4>
<p>Work in the Driver team providing automation capabilities for various applications. Work on Windows systems (WinAPI).</p>
<p>The Driver team provides the building blocks for automating the applications supported by the UiPath ecosystem. The team deals with both low level and high level details ranging from injecting code into target applications to calling well known APIs for application automation.</p>
<h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
<ul>
<li>
	<b>Driver Project - Added new functionality for Remote applications.</b>
	<br>
	Changed the C++ implementation to allow <b>remote-in-remote</b> (that is, automating applications running in VMs that themselves run in VMs).
	<br>
	Added new support for <b>Custom Remote Apps</b> (implemented using Microsoft's Remote Desktop ActiveX control) to better target custom implementations of remote applications. Created test application and used it to implement automated tests.
</li>
<li>
	<b>Driver Project - Added better support for VB6 applications.</b>
	<br>
	Changed the C++ implementation to allow this completely new kind of application. Created test application and used it to implement automated tests.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Software Developer, Continental Automotive Romania</h3>
<h4>August 2016 - January 2022</h4>
<p>Worked for the Interior division on multiple projects for navigation and telematics. Worked with object-oriented languages such as C++ and C#, in an agile way. Developed on Linux systems.</p>
<h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
<ul>
<li>
	<b>PSA Telematics Project - Developed the Positioning applications.</b>
	<br>
	The project ran on a Linux embedded device and was implemented using C++ and the Macchina framework.
	<br>
	I was the architect, and from that position I was responsible with providing a link between the team and the outside (other teams, project management, client).
	<br>
	I was responsible with defining the architecture of the applications, defining the tasks that the other colleagues were implementing, doing code reviews of their work, helping the testing team.
	<br>
	I was also involved in discussions with other architects, as well as providing suggestions for better implementation patterns.
</li>
<li>
	<b>Volvo Telematics Project - Worked on Power management.</b>
	<br>
	The project ran on a Linux embedded device and was implemented using C/C++.
	<br>
	I was a software architect, responsible with the Power Management of the Linux processor. From this position I was the link between the team and the outside (system architect, other teams, project management, client).
	<br>
	I was reponsible with defining the architecture, doing the implementation, helping the testing team, handling discutions with the team responsible for the micro-processor Power Management (that processor was the node responsible with providing power to the whole system, but it had to coordinate with the node that I was working on, as this one was running the user-facing applications).
	<br>
	I was responsible with implementing a character device driver to coordinate the suspend/power-off/reboot use cases with the micro-processor controlling the power supply.
</li>
<li>
	<b>Volvo Telematics Project - Developed the Diagnosis application; Worked on WiFi connection and on Remote connectivity with the car.</b>
	<br>
	The project ran on a Linux embedded device and was implemented using C/C++.
	<br>
	I was a software developer in the team, responsible with implementing new features for the applications.
	<br>
	I added support for remote connectivity authentication and authorization using SAML.
	<br>
	I added support for various diagnosis features (involving communication with other applications, both running on the same processor, and running on a different micro-processor).
</li>
<li>
	<b>Daimler Telematics Project - Developed a gateway between the cloud and the car that allowed the services inside the car to work with the backend as if it was an internal service.</b>
	<br>
	The project was a demo that ran on a Linux Qemu device emulating an embedded device and was implemented using C++.
	<br>
	I was a software developer in the team, responsible with linking <b>vsomeip</b> applications to <b>MQTT</b> applications. 
</li>
<li>
	<b>PSA Navigation Project - Worked in the team that acquired data from sensors and forwarded them to applications</b>
	<br>
	The project ran on a Linux embedded device and was implemented using C/C++. Pyhton was used for analysis of data collected during test drives.
	<br>
	I was a software developer in the team, responsible with implementing the Python test drive analysis tool that the other developers were using to analyze the behavior of the application in real world scenarios (for example, what the position accuracy is in a tunnel).
	<br>
	The tool was reading DLT logs and plotting them on a map, to easily check for deviations from the real road.
</li>
<li>
	<b>Fiat Navigation Project - Worked in the team that acquired data from sensors and forwarded them to applications</b>
	<br>
	The project ran on a Microsoft WinCE device and was implemented using C/C++.
	<br>
	I was a developer in the team, responsible with implementing new features that would help with testing the applications both on the device and on a Windows PC. 
</li>

<h3>Working Student, Continental Automotive Romania</h3>
<h4>January 2015 - August 2016</h4>
<p>Helped colleagues involved in testing with a library for one of the tools. Participated in reviews. Worked with object-oriented languages. Worked with source control tools.</p>
<h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
<ul>
<li>
	<b>C# Automated Testing tool</b>
	<br>
	Built and maintained a C# testing tool library that allowed our testers to automate most of their manual tests; the library offered functionality such as touchscreen presses, remote connection with the device or image comparison.
